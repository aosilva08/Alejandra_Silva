#3: A zscore is one term to describe data transformed to have mean zero and
#standard deviation one, given by: x - x_mean / x_std
#Write a function that takes any list-like object as a positional argument,
#then returns an object of the same dimensions with the zscores for the series.
#Use these two imported functions, and test your results on several lists of
#values

#4: A modified zscore uses the "median absolute deviation" to better handle
#outliers in the data, where the MAD is calculated by:
#  1. x - the median of the series
#  2. the absolute values of the results from 1
#  3. the median of the results from 2
#and finally, replace the standard deviation in the formula for the zscore from
#question 3 with the results from this process: x - x_mean / MAD
#
#Copy the function you created in 3 and create an optional key word argument that
#lets you override the default zscore calculation to instead use the modified
#version. This function should work in both question 3 and 4 without needing to
#change how you call it in part 3, because of its default behavior
